# Social Network Analysis – Project README

This project is part of a social-network analysis assignment using Gephi.  
It compares a normal communication network with a network where misinformation is spreading.

---

## 1. Objective
The assignment aims to:
- Build and analyze two user-interaction networks.
- Use Gephi to compute key structural metrics.
- Compare both networks to identify indicators of misinformation spread.
- Produce a written report explaining the results and network differences.

## 2. Included Files

### **1. social_network_report.doc**
This document contains:
- A full explanation of both graphs.
- Interpretation of Degree, Centrality, Betweenness, Modularity, Diameter, and Components.
- A comparison between the normal and misinformation networks.
- Visuals and supporting analysis.

### **2. assignment.gephi**
This file includes the two visual network graphs:
- **Graph A – Normal Network**  
  Shows natural clustering, clearer structure, and stable interaction patterns.

- **Graph B – Misinformation Network**  
  Shows fragmented clusters, long propagation paths, and a few central “bridge” nodes that push misinformation across groups.

---

## 3. Key Insights
Main findings from the analysis:
- Misinformation networks often have **higher fragmentation** (higher modularity or more components).
- They show a **larger diameter**, indicating long multi-layer propagation chains.
- Betweenness is concentrated in a few nodes, revealing **bridge accounts**.
- The normal network shows **more uniform structure** and smoother connectivity.

---

## 4. Purpose of the Assignment
The assignment teaches how to:
- Use Gephi to investigate network structure.
- Detect structural patterns linked to misinformation.
- Interpret centrality, clustering, and flow metrics in social networks.
- Understand how network topology affects information spread.
